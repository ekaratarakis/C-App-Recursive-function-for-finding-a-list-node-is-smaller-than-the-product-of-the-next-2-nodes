# C-App-Recursive-function-for-finding-a-list-node-is-smaller-than-the-product-of-the-next-2-nodes
The functionality of this C application is described as follows.
* The program asks from the user to enter the elements of a (non sorted) list of integers. The user can enter as many integers as he likes. 
* After that the program runs a recursive function "productCompare" to check if the list entered by the user has a node that is smaller that the product of the next 2 nodes (the last 2 nodes are excluded). For example the list **5->4->2->3->25->15->6** satisfies the condition above. The function "productCompare" returns NULL in case of seccess (a node found that is smaller from the product of the next 2 nodes). In case of a list that has 2 or less nodes we can consider that the condition above is satisfied.
* The program prints into the function "productCompare" a message when the list satisfies the condition above. In case it doesn't the program prints another appropriate message together with the triplet of the consecutive numbers that are not satisfy the condition above.
